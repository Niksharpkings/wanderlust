 ## WanderLust - Application Design and Concept

 Have you ever been hesitant to share your ideas and creativities in the same boring 
 social media platform? Or do you constantly worry about your privacy being sold?

 In a world full of trolls, likes, dislikes and censorship, WanderLust.com is a platform
 designed to display the creativity of individuals and businesses without the agony
 of third party influences - also AD free.

 Our idea is to have an app that inspires our visitors to take a break from the hustle and 
 bustle of life and the pressure of social media likes and comments. To travel and 
 adventure out to the world and hopefully, sign up and share back.

 # Our Task and Application Requirments
